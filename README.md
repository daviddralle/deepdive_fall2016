# Physics 7b Deep Dive, 2016

Welcome to the Physics 7b Deep Dive 2016 Folder! 

I'm the instructor, David Dralle. 

You can reach me with any questions or concerns at [dralle@berkeley.edu](dralle@berkeley.edu)

If you'd like to run any of the `Jupyter notebooks`, you'll want to get
the python package manager [Anaconda](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/index.html) installed on your computer, then
use Anaconda to install the `deepdive.yml` python environment. With 
this environment, you'll be able to run any notebook (.ipynb) in this folder.
